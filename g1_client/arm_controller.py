"""G1 arm controller for LingBot-VA inference.

Publishes 14 arm joint targets to rt/arm_sdk (motion-mode arm_sdk topic) at 50 Hz
with body-lock and velocity clamping. Adapted from
xr_teleoprate_copy/teleop/robot_control/robot_arm.py (G1_29_ArmController) but
stripped to the inference-only essentials.

Key responsibilities:
- Lock the legs and waist with high kp (so the locomotion service has authority
  cancelled for those joints — robot must be in ai mode standing on the ground)
- Stream the 14 arm joint targets at a fixed rate
- Rate-limit per-tick motion via velocity_limit (rad/s)
- Set motor_cmd[29].q = 1.0 to enable arm_sdk
- Compute CRC every tick
